# 42-mouse-scroll

"Ask and ye shall receive" - Anon

A simple launch agent to set the ByHost preference for mouse scrolling to UNNATURAL ðŸ˜±

Because ByHost preferences only apply to the current computer, automatically running this from your network home folder at every login will make sure your preferred settings follow you between computers @ 42.

The script will set the default to the current prior to installing and running `make`.  
To change the default, just edit the settings and run `~/.selway/updateMouse.sh`
